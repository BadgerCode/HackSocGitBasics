# Git Introduction #

### What is Git ###
**Git** is a version control system. This means it tracks and manages changes made to a collection of files.

In Git, _a collection of files_ is called a **Repository**.
Typically, you will use **one repository per project**<br>

If you're working on multiple independent systems which communicate with eachother, it's best to have one repository per system.<br>
This allows you to work on each system without the risk of changing 

## Why you should use Git in your projects ##
Simply put, Git will keep a detailed history of changes made to your project and can make working on a project with other people a lot easier.

### History ###
Git keeps track of changes in your repository. This can be used to:
* Find out when a change was made and who by
* Revert a change
* Find what other changes were made at the same time as a specific change
* Find all changes that have happened to a file
* Browse the repository at a specific point in time
* Find the last time any files in a directory were changed

### Collaboration ###

Git can be used to make collaboration on a project easier. Using Git:
* Multiple people can work on the repository at the same time
* People can work on changes in isolation, meaning they won't be affected by other changes being made at the same time.
* You can apply changes others have made to the repository to your own work when it is convenient for you.
* Using a service like GitHub, pull requests allow everyone to be involved in making a particular set of changes official. 
    * This allows them to review the changes and discuss parts they may not agree on. 
    * It also helps you to catch mistakes in your work as you can get another set of eyes to look over the exact changes you made.
